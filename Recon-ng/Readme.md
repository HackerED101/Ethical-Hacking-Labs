### Running Recon-ng and Creating a New Workspace

1. **Open the Terminal:**
   - In your Kali Linux, open the terminal.

2. **Launch Recon-ng:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     recon-ng
     ```
   - This command starts Recon-ng, initializing the framework for reconnaissance activities.

3. **Create a New Workspace:**
   - Once Recon-ng is running, you need to create a new workspace. In this example, let's name it `CEH` (Certified Ethical Hacker):
     ```bash
     workspace create CEH
     ```
   - This command sets up a new workspace named `CEH` within Recon-ng. Workspaces help organize your reconnaissance data and activities.

4. **Verify Workspace Creation:**
   - To confirm that the workspace `CEH` was successfully created, you can list all available workspaces:
     ```bash
     workspaces list
     ```
   - You should see `CEH` listed among the workspaces, indicating it has been created and is active.

### Setting target domain exploring marketplace

1. **Set Target Domain:**
   - Once inside Recon-ng, you need to set the target domain for network reconnaissance. Replace `example.com` with your actual target domain:
     ```bash
     >db insert domains
     >certifiedhacker.com
     ```
   - You can view the added the domain by typing:   
     ```bash
     show domains
     ```

2. **Load Modules from the Marketplace:**
   - Recon-ng offers various modules through its marketplace for specific reconnaissance tasks. Hereâ€™s how you can load and use them:
   
     a. **List Available Modules:**
        - To list all available modules in the marketplace, use:
          ```bash
          marketplace search
          ```
        - This command displays a list of modules categorized by different types of reconnaissance activities.

     b. **Load a Specific Module:**
        - Choose a module relevant to your network reconnaissance needs. For example, we will use the hackertarget module in this tutorial:
          ```bash
          marketplace install hackertarget
          ```
          This command installs the `hackertarget` module which can be used to gather subdomains related to the specified domain.

          ```bash
          modules load hackertarget
          ```
          This will load that module, without loading you will be unable to use it.

3. **Set Target Domain:**
   - After loading the module, set the target domain for reconnaissance. Replace `certifiedhacker.com` with any target domain:
     ```bash
     options set SOURCE certifiedhacker.com
     ```
     - This command sets `certifiedhacker.com` as the target domain for the loaded module.

4. **Run the Module:**
   - Execute the module to perform reconnaissance on the target domain:
     ```bash
     run
     ```
     - This command starts the module and gathers information based on its functionality.

5. **Review Results:**
   - Recon-ng will display results based on the module's execution. Results might include subdomains, IP addresses, URLs, or other relevant information retrieved from the target domain.

### Additional Notes:
- **Explore Marketplace:** The Recon-ng marketplace offers a wide range of modules beyond basic domain and host reconnaissance. Explore modules tailored to your specific reconnaissance objectives.
- **Module Customization:** Each module may have specific options and configurations that can be customized using `options set` before running `run`.
- **Documentation:** Refer to Recon-ng's official documentation for detailed information on available modules and their usage. 
- **Output:** If your response is working correctly but with messy queries and values, just type show hosts for a clean output

 6. **Load brute_hosts from the Marketplace:**
     
     a. **Load a Specific Module:**
     - To install and use another module, you have to exit the first one:
          ```bash
          back
          ```
 - Choose a module relevant to your network reconnaissance needs.We will use brute_hosts module in this tutorial:
          ```bash
          marketplace install recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
          ```
- This command installs the `brute_hosts` module which can be used to brute force subdomains related to the specified domain.

            ```bash
          modules load recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
          ```
- This will load that module, without loading you will be unable to use it.

7. **Set Target Domain:**
   - After loading the module, set the target domain for reconnaissance. Replace `certifiedhacker.com` with any target domain:
     ```bash
     options set SOURCE certifiedhacker.com
     ```
- This command sets `certifiedhacker.com` as the target domain for the loaded module.
- You can source and wordlists by writing following command:
     ```bash
     info
     ```

8. **Run the Module:**
   - Execute the module to perform reconnaissance on the target domain:
     ```bash
     run
     ```
     - This command starts the module and gathers information based on its functionality.

### Generating a report
- Now that you have collected your data, You can create a report conataining all the information
- We will install reporting module from marketplace:
  
   ```bash
   marketplace install reporting/html
          ```
   
```bash
   modules load reporting/html
          ```

- This will load that module, without loading you will be unable to use it.
   
- You can create a report in several formats, you can check the marketplace for supported formats.
- You will need to assign the following values: Creator,Customer, Filename

```bash
Options set CREATOR <yourname>
          ```

```bash
Options set CUSTOMER <yourcustomername>
          ```

```bash
Options set FILENAME home/kali/Desktop/Filename
          ```

**Run the Module:**
   - Execute the module to generate a report:

    ```bash
 run
          ```

 ### Recon-ng for gathering personal information
     
**Gather contacts associated with a domain:**
- This module will use wohis data and gather all the personal information of a domain.
  
     ```bash
          marketplace install recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
          ```
       ```bash
          modules load recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
          ```

     - Check the information to run the module:
          ```bash
          info
          ```

      - After loading the module, set the target domain for whois. Replace `facebook.com` with any target domain:
     ```bash
     options set SOURCE facebook.com
     
   - Execute the module:
    ```bash
          run
          ```
